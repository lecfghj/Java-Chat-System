### Project Description: Java Chat System

**Project Overview:**
This project is a Java-based chat application that simulates real-time communication between users. The system models essential components of a chat platform, such as contacts, chats, messages, and users. Users can send messages, create and manage group chats, and track interactions with other users through a detailed contact list. The project emphasizes object-oriented design, efficient data management, and basic user persistence.

**Key Features:**
1. **User and Contact Management:**
   - Users are represented as objects that can manage contacts. Contacts are stored in a list and sorted alphabetically for ease of access.
   - Users can add, remove, and interact with their contacts.
   - Contact details include name, phone number, and profile image, which can be customized or defaulted.

2. **Chat Functionality:**
   - Users can create chat groups, name them, and add contacts as members.
   - A user can be a part of multiple chats, and each chat can store multiple messages.
   - Users can send messages to individual contacts or groups.

3. **Messaging System:**
   - Messages contain content, author information, and timestamp data.
   - Messages can be marked as read or unread.
   - Users can react to messages using "like" or "dislike" functionality.
   - Messages track reactions and show counts for each reaction type.
   - Recent messages (up to the last three) are tracked for each user.

4. **Data Persistence:**
   - The system supports saving user data to a file and loading it back, ensuring continuity between sessions.
   - Users, along with their contact lists and chats, can be saved and retrieved through serialization.

5. **Profile and Image Handling:**
   - Each user and contact can have a profile image.
   - The system uses `ImageProcessing` to load images from the file system, including default images for users without custom profile pictures.

**Class Structure:**
- **User:** Extends `Contact`, adds user-specific features like maintaining a contact list and chats. The user can create chats, send messages, and save/load their data.
- **Contact:** Represents an individual in the chat system. Stores name, phone number, profile image, and a history of recent messages.
- **Chat:** A collection of `Contact` members and `Message` objects. Supports adding/removing members and sending messages within the chat.
- **Message:** Represents the text or content sent in chats. Includes reactions (like/dislike), author, and status (read/unread).
- **ImageProcessing:** Provides functionality for loading and handling profile images.

**Main Features in Code:**
1. **User and Contact Management:**
   - Users can add contacts and maintain a sorted list of contacts.
   - Users can create new chats and add members.

2. **Messaging and Chats:**
   - The system supports adding messages to chats and handling reactions.
   - Unread messages can be tracked, and once a chat is accessed, the messages are marked as read.

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - Users can save their session data to a file and load it in the next session, allowing for continuity between user logins.

4. **Image Management:**
   - Profile images are handled via the `ImageProcessing` class, which allows users to set custom profile pictures or fall back to a default image.


This chat system demonstrates fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, data persistence, and file handling. It provides a flexible platform for future extensions into more advanced features like real-time communication and a graphical interface.
